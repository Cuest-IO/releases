Congratulations on installing Cuest Application using Helm!

To ensure that all necessary certificates are properly signed and approved, follow these steps:

1. Check the status of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) by running the following command:
   kubectl get csr

   This command will list all pending CSRs along with their status. Look for any CSRs that are in the "Pending" state.

2. If you find any CSRs that require approval, you can approve them using the following command:
   kubectl certificate approve <csr_name>

   Replace <csr_name> with the name of the CSR that needs approval, as listed in the output of the previous command.

3. After approving the CSRs, you can verify that they have been signed and are now ready for use by running:
   kubectl get csr

   All approved CSRs should now have a status of "Approved" or "Signed".

4. Once all CSRs are approved and signed, your certificates should be ready for use by your application.
